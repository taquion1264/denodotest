Test for Denodo 

its an attempt tu use DDD in a simple Java app some clases can be renamed to DDD like Service´s one to usecase, also the repositories can be called DAO due its the pattern used on there with JDBC,
the questions were solved within the app so there´s the endpoint purchase_details_amount_filtered which has the qquery to filter between two dates and amounts bigger than 100
the database its a memory´s H2 wich its populated in boostrap time
I couldn´t elaborate more test due time
